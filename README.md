# Extended-Gamblers-Ruin-Problem
A computational exploration of an extended version of the classic Gambler's Ruin problem.

### The Problem
The Gambler's Ruin Problem is a classic probability problem. The original problem statement is as follows: suppose you are gambler making a series of bets. On each bet, you bet one coin, and there is a probability p that you win and receive two coins back (thus increasing your total wealth by one) and a probability 1-p that you lose the coin that you just bet (thus decreasing your total wealth by one). Being a stubborn gambler, you will not leave the casino until either your total wealth has reached some number of coins N or you have lost all of your money. Now, given values of 0 <= p <= 1, N, and the amount of money you start with, i, with 0 <= i <= N, what is the probability that you will go broke (or equivalently the probability that your wealth reaches N)?

This version of the problem is very stimulating in itself, and has a relatively simple but enlightening solution. To the readers that have not seen it before, I encourage you to try and find its solution, being very careful not to spoil the reward by consulting outside sources. If a hint must be given, it is that this is a probability problem, and probability problems often have nice connections to recursive structures.

But now we shift our attention to another version of the problem. Several generalizations exist, but the one that we are interested is as follows: suppose that as the gambler you could now bet any number of coins that you desire on each turn (provided of course that you have those coins). Everything else is as before; you will still not leave the casino until either your wealth runs out or reaches N, you start with i coins, and on each bet, there is probability p of winning and 1-p loosing. Notice however that now on each bet, if you win, your net wealth increases by k coins, and if you lose, your net wealth decreases by k coins, where 1 <= k <= current wealth is the amount that you chose to bet. Also notice that it is now possible to do things such as bet all of your money at once, or bet so much on a turn that if you win your wealth would surpass N (say if you have 8 coins and N is 10, if you bet all 8 coins and win then your wealth would be 16 coins, at which point you would just exit the casino).

Now what is the probability of winning? You should notice that since you now have potentially many choices on each bet, there is a notion of an optimal strategy such that given values of p, N, and current wealth, there is an optimal amount of coins k that you can bet that maximizes your chances of getting to N. Finding this optimal strategy (or strategies) is half the battle, and finding the overall probability of winning using this optimal strategy is the other half.
